# The Right Move
A small indie Metroidvania with an emphasis on puzzle-solving. Start by only being able to move right and unlock more moves as you platform to find an exit. 

This game was initially developed for [Metroidvania Month 22](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-22), but the lack of free time and goals changed, so the project is now being developed for my own sake.
